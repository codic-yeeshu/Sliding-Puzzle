## Sliding Puzzle Game 

This repository holds a simple sliding puzzle game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Your goal is to rearrange shuffled tiles of an image to recreate the original picture.

### Functionality:

- Loads an image and cleanly divides it into tiles.
- Randomizes the tile positions, creating a challenging puzzle.
- Detects when the puzzle is solved and displays a celebratory "You Win!" message.
- Offers a "New Game" button to restart with a fresh shuffle.

### Technologies Used:

- **HTML** defines the structure and layout of the webpage.
- **CSS** styles the visual elements of the game, enhancing its appearance.
- **JavaScript** powers the game's logic, including image manipulations, tile movement, and win detection.
